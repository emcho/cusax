  CUSAX: Combined Use of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the
           Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)
                        draft-ivov-xmpp-cusax-05

Abstract

   This document describes suggested practices for combined use of the
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Extensible Messaging and
   Presence Protocol (XMPP).  Such practices aim to provide a single
   fully featured real-time communication service by using complementary
   subsets of features from each of the protocols.  Typically such
   subsets would include telephony capabilities from SIP and instant
   messaging and presence capabilities from XMPP.  This specification
   does not define any new protocols or syntax for either SIP or XMPP.
   However, implementing it may require modifying or at least
   reconfiguring existing client and server-side software.  Also, it is
   not the purpose of this document to make recommendations as to
   whether or not such combined use should be preferred to the
   mechanisms provided natively by each protocol (for example, SIP's
   SIMPLE or XMPP's Jingle).  It merely aims to provide guidance to
   those who are interested in such a combined use.

1.  Introduction

   Historically SIP [RFC3261] and XMPP [RFC6120] have often been
   implemented and deployed with different purposes: from its very start
   SIP's primary goal has been to provide a means of conducting
   "Internet telephone calls".  XMPP on the other hand, has, from its
   Jabber days, been mostly used for instant messaging and presence
   [RFC6121], as well as related services such as groupchat rooms
   [XEP-0045].

   For various reasons, these trends have continued through the years
   even after each of the protocols had been equipped to provide the
   features it was initially lacking:

   o  Today, in the context of the SIMPLE working group, the IETF has
      defined a number of protocols and protocol extensions that not
      only allow for SIP to be used for regular instant messaging and



Ivov, et al.           Expires November 03, 2013                [Page 2]

Internet-Draft        Combined Use of SIP and XMPP              May 2013


      presence but that also provide mechanisms for elaborated features
      such as multi-user chats, server-stored contact lists, file
      transfer and others.

   o  Similarly, the XMPP community and the XMPP Standards Foundation
      have worked on defining a number of XMPP Extension Protocols
      (XEPs) that provide XMPP implementations with the means of
      establishing end-to-end sessions.  These extensions are often
      jointly referred to as Jingle and arguably their most popular use
      case is audio and video calling.

   Despite these advances, SIP remains the protocol of choice for
   telephony-like services, especially in enterprises where users are
   accustomed to features such as voice mail, call park, call queues,
   conference bridges and many others that are rarely (if at all)
   available in Jingle-based software.  XMPP implementations, on the
   other hand, greatly outnumber and outperform those available for
   instant messaging and presence extensions developed in the SIMPLE WG,
   such as MSRP [RFC4975] and XCAP [RFC4825].

   For these reasons, in a number of cases adopters have found
   themselves needing a set of features that are not offered by any
   single-protocol solution but that separately exist in SIP and XMPP
   products.  The idea of seamlessly using both protocols together would
   hence often appeal to service providers.  Most often, such a service
   would employ SIP exclusively for audio, video, and telephony services
   and rely on XMPP for anything else varying from chat, contact list
   management, and presence to whiteboarding and exchanging files.
   Because these services and clients involve the combined use of SIP
   and XMPP, we label them "CUSAX" for short.

   This document explains how such hybrid offerings can be achieved with
   a minimum of modifications to existing software while providing an
   optimal user experience.  It covers server discovery, determining a
   SIP AOR while using XMPP, and determining an XMPP Jabber Identifier

   ("JID") from incoming SIP requests.  Most of the text here pertains
   to client behavior but it also recommends certain server-side
   configurations.

   Note that this document is focused on coexistence of SIP and XMPP
   functionality in end-user-oriented clients.  By intent it does not
   define methods for protocol-level mapping between SIP and XMPP, as
   might be used within a server-side gateway between a SIP network and
   an XMPP network (a separate series of documents has been produced
   that defines such mappings).  More generally, this document does not
   describe service policies for inter-domain communication (often
   called "federation") between service providers (e.g., how a service
   provider that offers a combined SIP-XMPP service might communicate
   with a SIP-only or XMPP-only service), nor does it describe the
   reasons why a service provider might choose SIP or XMPP for various
   features.

   This document concentrates on use cases where the SIP services and
   XMPP services are controlled by one and the same provider, since that
   assumption greatly simplifies both client implementation and server-
   side deployment (e.g., a single service provider can enforce common
   or coordinated policies across both the SIP and XMPP aspects of a
   CUSAX service, which is not possible if a SIP service is offered by
   one provider and an XMPP service is offered by another).  Since this
   document is of an informational nature, it is not unreasonable for
   clients to apply some of the guidelines here even in cases where
   there is no established relationship between the SIP and the XMPP
   services (for example, it is reasonable for a client to provide a way
   for its users to easily start a call to a phone number recorded in a
   vCard).  However, the exact set of rules to follow in such cases is
   left to application developers.

   Finally, this document makes a further simplifying assumption by
   discussing only the use of a single client, not use of and
   coordination among multiple endpoints controlled by the same user
   (e.g., user agents running simultaneously on a laptop computer,
   tablet, and mobile phone).

2.  Client Bootstrap

   One of the main problems of using two distinct protocols when
   providing one service is the impact on usability.  Email services,
   for example, have long been affected by the mixed use of SMTP for
   outgoing mail and POP3 or IMAP for incoming mail.  Although standard
   service discovery methods (such as the proper DNS records) make it
   possible for a user agent to locate the right host(s) at which to
   connect, they do not provide the kind of detailed information that is
   needed to actually configure the user agent for use with the service.

Internet-Draft        Combined Use of SIP and XMPP              May 2013


   As a result, it is rather complicated for inexperienced users to
   configure a mail client and start using it with a new service, and
   Internet service providers often need to provide configuration
   instructions for various mail clients.  Client developers and
   communication device manufacturers on the other hand often ship with
   a number of wizards that enable users to easily set up a new account
   for a number of popular email services.  While this may improve the
   situation to some extent, the user experience is still clearly sub-
   optimal.

   While it should be possible for CUSAX users to manually configure
   their separate SIP and XMPP accounts, dual-stack SIP/XMPP clients
   ought to provide means of online provisioning, typically by means of
   a web-based service at an HTTP URI.  While the specifics of such
   mechanisms are outside the scope of this specification, they should
   make it possible for a service provider to remotely configure the
   clients based on minimal user input (e.g., only a user ID and
   password).

   Because many of the features that a CUSAX client would privilege in
   one protocol would also be available in the other, clients should
   make it possible for such features to be disabled for a specific
   account.  In particular, it is suggested that clients allow for audio
   and video calling features to be disabled for XMPP accounts, and that
   instant messaging and presence features should also be made optional
   for SIP accounts.

   The main advantage of this approach is that clients would be able to
   continue to function properly and use the complete feature set of
   standalone SIP and XMPP accounts.

3.  Operation

   Once client bootstrap has completed, a client needs to log in
   independently to the SIP and XMPP accounts that make up the CUSAX
   "service" and then maintain both these connections.  In order to
   improve the user experience, when reporting connection status clients
   may also wish to present the XMPP connection as an "instant
   messaging" or a "chat" account.  Similarly they could also depict the
   SIP connection as a "Voice and Video" or a "Telephony" connection.
   The exact naming is of course entirely up to implementers.  The point
   is that, in cases where SIP and XMPP are components of a service
   offered by a single provider, such presentation could help users
   better understand why they are being shown two different connections
   for what they perceive as a single service.  It could alleviate
   especially situations where one of these connections is disrupted
   while the other one is still active.  Naturally, the developers of a
   CUSAX client or the providers of a CUSAX service might decide to



Ivov, et al.           Expires November 03, 2013                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft        Combined Use of SIP and XMPP              May 2013


   privilege one bundle of features (e.g., not showing the user as
   online if the XMPP account is connected but the SIP account has been
   disconnected), or to consider both aspects to be co-equal (e.g., not
   showing the user as online if one of the accounts is offline).

   Once a CUSAX client has been provisioned/configured to connect to the
   corresponding SIP and XMPP services it would proceed by retrieving
   its XMPP roster.  In order for CUSAX to function properly, XMPP
   service administrators should make sure that at least one of the
   vCard [RFC6350] "tel" fields for each contact is properly populated
   with a SIP URI or a phone number when an XMPP protocol for vCard
   storage is used (e.g., [XEP-0054] or [XEP-0292]).  There are no
   limitations as to the form of that number.  For example while it is
   desirable to maintain a certain consistency between SIP AORs and XMPP
   JIDs, that is by no means required.  It is quite important however
   that the phone number or SIP AOR stored in the vCard be reachable
   through the SIP aspect of this CUSAX service.

   Additionally, clients that have separete triggers (buttons) for audio
   and video calls may choose to use the presence or absence of the
   "video" tel type defined in [RFC6350] and enable or disable the
   possibility for starting video calls accordingly.

   To ensure that the foregoing approach is always respected, service
   providers might consider (1) preventing clients (and hence users)
   from modifying the vCard "tel" fields or (2) applying some form of
   validation before storing changes.  Of course such validation would
   be feasible mostly in cases where a single provider controls both the
   XMPP and the SIP service since such providers would "know" (e.g.,
   based on use of a common user database for both services) what SIP
   AOR corresponds to a given XMPP user.

                      +--------------+

                       Figure 2: Example Deployment

   When rendering the roster for a particular XMPP account CUSAX clients
   should make sure that users are presented with a "Call" option for
   each roster entry that has a properly set "tel" field.  This has to
   be the case even if calling features have been disabled for that
   particular XMPP account, as advised by this document.  The usefulness
   of such a feature is not limited to CUSAX.  After all, numbers are
   entered in vCards in order to be dialed and called.  Hence, as long
   as an XMPP client has any means of conducting a call it may wish to
   make it possible for the user to easily dial any numbers that it
   learned through whatever means.

   Also, in order to improve usability, in cases where clients are
   provisioned with only a single telephony-capable account they ought
   to initiate calls immediately upon user request without asking users
   to indicate an account that the call should go through.  This way
   CUSAX users (whose only account with calling capabilities is usually
   the SIP part of their service) would have a better experience, since
   from the user's perspective calls "just work at the click of a
   button".

   In order to provide a similar experience when the user has multiple
   telephony-capable accounts, client implementers may choose to
   indicate the existence of a special relationship between the SIP and
   XMPP accounts of a CUSAX service.  For example, let's say that
   Alice's service provider has opened both an XMPP account and a SIP
   account for her.  During or after provisioning, her client could
   indicate that alice@xmpp.example.com has a CUSAX relation to
   alice@sip.example.com (i.e., that they are two aspects of the same
   service).  This way whenever Alice triggers a call to a contact in
   her XMPP roster, the client would preferentially initiate this call
   through her example.com SIP account even if other possibilities exist
   (such as the XMPP account where the vCard was obtained or a SIP
   account with another provider).

   If, on the other hand, no relationship has been configured or
   discovered between a SIP account and an XMPP account, and the client
   is aware of multiple telephony-capable accounts, it ought to present
   the user with the choice of reaching the contact through any of those
   accounts.  This includes the source XMPP account where the vCard was
   obtained (in case its telephony capabilities are not disabled through
   configuration or provisioning), in order to guarantee proper
   operation for XMPP accounts that are not part of a CUSAX deployment.

Internet-Draft        Combined Use of SIP and XMPP              May 2013


   In addition to discovering phone numbers from vCards, clients may
   also check for alternative communication methods as advertised in
   XMPP presence broadcasts and Personal Eventing Protocol nodes as
   described in XEP-0152: Reachability Addresses [XEP-0152].  However,
   these indications are merely hints, and a receiving client ought not
   associate a SIP address and an XMPP address unless it has some way to
   verify the association (e.g., the vCard of the XMPP account lists the
   SIP address and the vCard of the SIP account lists the XMPP address,
   or the association is made explicit in a record provided by a trusted
   directory).  Alternatively or in cases where vCard or directory data
   is not available, a CUSAX client could take the user's own address
   book as the canonical source for contact addresses.

   The client should use XMPP for all other forms of communication with
   the contacts from its roster, which will occur naturally because they
   were retrieved through XMPP and only audio/video features were
   disabled in the XMPP stack.

   When receiving SIP calls, clients may wish to determine the identity
   of the caller and a corresponding XMPP roster entry so that users
   could revert to chatting or other forms of communication that require
   XMPP.  To do so clients could search their roster for an entry whose
   vCard has a "tel" field matching the originator of the call.

   In addition, in order to avoid the effort of iterating over an entire
   roster and retrieving all vCards, CUSAX clients may use a SIP Call-
   Info header whose 'purpose' token field parameter has a value of
   "impp" as described in [I-D.saintandre-impp-call-info] such as the
   following:


   Call-Info: <xmpp:alice@example.com> ;purpose=impp



   Note that the information from the Call-Info header should only be
   used as a cue: the actual AOR-to-JID binding would still need to be
   confirmed by a vCard entry.  If this confirmation succeeds the client
   would not need to search the entire roster and retrieve all vCards.
   Not performing the check would allow any caller (including malicious
   ones) to employ someone else's identity and perform various scams or
   Man-in-the-Middle attacks.

4.  Multi-Party Interactions

   CUSAX clients that support the SIP conferencing framework [RFC4353]
   can detect when a call they are participating in is actually a
   conference and can then subscribe for conference state updates as per
   [RFC4575].  A regular SIP user agent would also use the same
   conference URI for text communication with the Message Session Relay
   Protocol (MSRP).  However, given that SIP's instant messaging
   capabilities would normally be disabled (or simply not supported) in
   CUSAX deployments, an XMPP Multi-User Chat (MUC) [XEP-0045]
   associated with the conference can be announced/discovered through
   <service-uris> bearing the "grouptextchat" purpose
   [I-D.ivov-grouptextchat-purpose].

   Once a CUSAX client joins the MUC associated with a particular call
   it should not rely on any synchronization between the two.  Both the
   SIP conference and the XMPP MUC would function independently, each
   issuing and delivering its own state updates.  It is hence possible
   that that certain peers would temporarily or permanently be reachable
   in only one of the two conferences.  This would typically be the case
   with single-stack clients that have only joined the SIP call or the
   XMPP MUC.  It is therefore important for CUSAX clients to provide a
   clear indication to users as to the level of participation of the
   various participants.  In other words, a user needs to be able to
   easily understand whether a certain participant can receive text
   messages, audio/video, or both.

   Of course, tighter integration between the XMPP MUC and the SIP
   conference is also possible.  Permissions, roles, kicks and bans that
   are granted and performed in the MUC can easily be imitated by the
   conference focus/mixer into the SIP call.  If for example, a certain
   MUC member is muted, the conference mixer can choose to also apply
   the mute on the media stream corresponding to that participant.  The
   details and exact level of such integration is of course entirely up
   to implementers and service providers.

   The approach above describes one relatively lightweight possibility
   of combining SIP and XMPP multi-party interaction semantics without
   requiring tight integration between the two.  As with the rest of
   this specification, this approach is by no means normative.
   Implementation and future specifications may define other methods or
   provide other suggestions for improving the Unified Communications
   user experience in cases of multi-user chats in conference calling.

5.  Federation

   In theory there are no technical reasons why federation would require
   special behaviour from CUSAX clients.  However, it is worth noting



Ivov, et al.           Expires November 03, 2013                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft        Combined Use of SIP and XMPP              May 2013


   that differences in administration policies may sometimes lead to
   potentially confusing user experiences.

5.1.  The Common Case

   For example, let's say atlanta.example.com observes the CUSAX
   policies described in this specification.  All XMPP users at
   atlanta.example.com are hence configured to have vCards that match
   their SIP identities.  Alice is therefore used to making free, high-
   quality SIP calls to all the people in her roster.  Alice can also
   make calls to the PSTN by simply dialing numbers.  She may even be
   used to these calls being billed to her online account so she would
   careful about how long they last.  This is not a problem for her
   since she can easily distinguish between a free SIP call (one that
   she made by calling one her roster entries) from a paid PSTN call
   that she dialed as a number.

5.2.  The CUSAX Federation Confusion

   Then Alice adds xmpp:bob@biloxi.example.com.  The Biloxi domain only
   has an XMPP service.  There is no SIP server and Bob uses a regular,
   XMPP-only client.  Bob has however added his mobile number to his
   vCard in order to make it easily accessible to his contacts.  Alice's
   client would pick up this number and make it possible for Alice to
   start a call to Bob's mobile phone number.

   This could be a problem because, other than the fact that Bob's
   address is from a different domain, Alice would have no obvious and
   straightforward cues telling her that this is in fact a call to the
   PSTN.  In addition to the potentially lower audio quality, Alice may
   also end up incurring unexpected charges for such calls.

5.3.  The Recommendation

   In order to avoid such issues, providers maintaining a CUSAX service
   for the users in their domain may choose to provide additional cues
   (e.g., a user interface warning or an an audio tone or message)
   indicating that a call would incur charges.

   A slightly less disturbing scenario, where a SIP service might only
   allow communication with intra-domain numbers, would simply prevent
   Alice from establishing a call with Bob's mobile.  Providers should
   hence make sure that calls to extra-domain numbers are flagged with
   an appropriate audio or textual warning.

   Use of the same user agent with two different accounts providing
   complementary features introduces the possibility of mismatches
   between the security profiles of those accounts or features.  For
   example, the SIP aspect and XMPP aspect of the CUSAX service might
   offer different authentication options (e.g., digest authentication
   for SIP as specified in [RFC3261] and SCRAM authentication [RFC5802]
   for XMPP as specified in [RFC6120]).  Similarly, a CUSAX client might
   successfully negotiate Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] when
   connecting to the XMPP aspect of the service but not when connecting
   to the SIP aspect.  Such mismatches could introduce the possibility
   of downgrade attacks.  User agent developers and service providers
   ought to ensure that such mismatches are avoided as much as possible.

   Refer to the specifications for the relevant SIP and XMPP features
   for detailed security considerations applying to each "stack" in a
   CUSAX client.
